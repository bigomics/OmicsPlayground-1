Uploading your data in Omics Playground

.. _`uploading through the interface`:


..
    This content needs to be expanded (we need to add a section on generating contrasts through the platfrm and one on the computation option)

Users can import their data from the **Upload data** panel located under the 
:ref:`Home` module. The platform requires a file with the read counts and one with a description of the samples at the minimum. An optional file with the desired contrasts can also be provided. The format of files must be comma-separated-values (CSV) text.
It is important to name and format the files as explained in the previous sections.

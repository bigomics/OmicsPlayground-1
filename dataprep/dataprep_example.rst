Data preparation examples
================================================================================

In this section we provide three example cases to guide users for preparing 
their input data and injecting it into the platform. Basically, the example cases 
illustriate how to prepare an input data:

1. from FASTQ files, 
2. from gene counts table or GEO repository,
3. from single-cell experiment.


From FASTQ files
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If users have FASTQ files, we provide scripts to obtain
gene counts through quality control, trimming, quantification of gene abundance,
and so on. Although the script implements the Salmon, users can modify and use 
any other software, including Kallisto or Star.


From gene counts table or GEO repository
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Users can provide their own gene counts or download the relevant data from 
repositories such as GEO. 


From single-cell data
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

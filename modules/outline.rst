================================================================================

We subdivided the platform interface into Basic and Expert modes. 
Basic mode includes fundamental analysis modules such as :ref:`Datatab`, :ref:`Clustering`,
:ref:`Expression`, and :ref:`Enrichment`, while Expert mode includes additional modules such 
as :ref:`Functional`, :ref:`Intersect`, :ref:`Signature`, and :ref:`Biomarker` and :ref:`scProfiling`. 
Users can choose the interface mode according to their experience. The main purpose of interface 
separation is to provide analysis features that are suitable for the 
background of users without overstraining them.



Each figure or table on the platform is assigned the following interactive buttons, where:

* Info: Provides detailed information about the figure or table.
* Settings: Users can specify additional settings if applicable.
* Download: Downloads the figure as PDF or the table in CSV format.

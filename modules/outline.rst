Main menu
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Using the main menu on top, you can navigate through the different
analysis modules. Generally you want to start from top to bottom, from specific gene-wise to the more higher-level functional
analysis modules. Some users prefer the other way around.

By default, the following menu items are present, namely :ref:`Home`,
:ref:`DataView`, :ref:`Clustering`, :ref:`Expression`,
:ref:`Enrichment` and :ref:`Signature`, while :ref:`CellProfiling` is
an optional choice. The last menu item :ref:`User` (with user icon)
contains user settings, a help submenu and logout buttons.

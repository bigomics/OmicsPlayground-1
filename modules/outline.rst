User interface
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We subdivided the platform interface into Basic and Expert modes. 
Basic mode includes fundamental analysis modules such as :ref:`Home`, 
:ref:`DataView`, :ref:`Clustering`, :ref:`DEGs`, :ref:`DESGs`,
:ref:`Intersection` and :ref:`Functional`,  while Expert
mode includes additional modules such as 
:ref:`Signature`, :ref:`Biomarker` and :ref:`scProfiling`. 
Users can choose the interface mode according to their level of expertise. 
The main purpose of having two different modes is to provide a customisable 
experience suited to each userâ€™s background.

Each figure or table on the platform is assigned the following interactive buttons, where:

* Info: provides detailed information about the figure or table.
* Settings: users can specify additional settings if applicable.
* Download: downloads the figure as PDF or the table in CSV format.

Glossary
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Signature: a list of selected genes (e.g. by significance or fold change),
* Condition: a specific phenotype group (e.g. tumor or control),
* Contrast: a comparison between two conditions (e.g. tumor vs control),
* Profile: a vector of fold changes corresponding to a certain comparison,
* Hierarchical clustering: a method that groups similar samples into groups,
* Q value: an FDR-adjusted p value,
* Biomarker: a biological feature (gene, mutation or gene set) that characterises a specific physiological or pathological process.

Main menu
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Using the main menu on top, you can navigate through the different
analysis modules. Generally you want to start from top to bottom, from specific gene-wise to the more higher-level functional
analysis modules. Some users prefer the other way around.

By default, the following menu items are present, namely :ref:`Load`,
:ref:`DataView`, :ref:`Clustering`, :ref:`Expression`,
:ref:`Genesets`, :ref:`Compare` and :ref:`SystemsBio`.

The **Help** menu is located on the top right hand corner. The menu links to the online platform documentation (the page you are currently viewing), a collection of video tutorials on youtube, the community forum of the platform, the Github webpage, where busg can be reported, and a collection of case studies based on Omics Playground.

Clicking "App settings" will take the user to a new page with two tabs: **App settings & News** and ** Resource info**.

There are two panels under the **App settings & News** tab: **Application options** and **new features**.

:**Application options**: Through this panel, users can enable beta features, disable alerts and enable captions for the plots.

:**New features**: This panel provides a list of new features implemented with each new update of the platform.

Three panels are found under **Resource info**: **Timings**, **PGX slot sizes** and **R object sizes**.

:**Timings**: The timings table reports more detailed information about the object dimensions, object sizes and execution times of the methods.

:**PGX slot sizes**: This table provides details about the pgx object.

:**R object sizes**: This table provides size details about R objects.

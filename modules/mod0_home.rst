The platform starts running from the home page. Basically, this module contains 
general information about all available datasets. For each dataset, this tab 
reports a brief description as well as the total number of samples, genes, gene 
sets (or pathways), the corresponding phenotypes and the collection date. Users 
can select and load the data of their interest and start the analysis from here.

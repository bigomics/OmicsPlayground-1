Intersection analysis
================================================================================

The intersection analysis module enables users to compare multiple contrasts by intersecting the genes of profiles. Its main goal is to identify contrasts showing similar profiles. 

For the selected contrasts, the platform provides volcano plots and pairwise correlation plots between the profiles under the \texttt{pairs} tab. Simultaneously, it plots a Venn diagram with the number of intersecting genes between the profiles in the \texttt{venn diagram} section (\textbf{Supp. Fig. 21}). The list of intersecting genes with further details is also reported in an interactive table, where users can select and remove a particular contrast from the intersection analysis. In addition, it is possible to check a scatter plot of two profiles as well as the correlation-heatmap of multiple profiles under the \texttt{two-pairs} and \texttt{correlation} tabs, respectively. The \texttt{connectivity} graph tab constructs a network, in which nodes represent contrasts and edges are obtained from the pairwise-correlation of corresponding profiles (\textbf{Supp. Fig. 22-24}).

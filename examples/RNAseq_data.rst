RNA-sequencing data
================================================================================

To elucidate the mechanism of action of a new drug, or for the intention of drug 
repurposing, it is often useful to find other drugs that have similar or opposing
signatures compared to some given fold change profile.

Data set
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
As an example, using data from GSE114716
from \cite{Goswami2018Modulation}.

GSE114716: Drug mechanism of action 


Signature
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
\textbf{Fig. \ref{results_figure2}f} shows the top ranked drugs with most similar
or most opposing signatures to Ipilimumab, a novel monoclonal antibody targeting
CTLA-4 used in tumour therapy. 

Biomarker
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The list contains several known anti-tumoral drugs, such as bortezomib and 
palbociclib, but also highlights relationships with other compounds not normally
used in tumor therapy, such as emetine, an anti-protozoal drug with anti-tumoral
properties \cite{Foreman2018Emetine, Sun2015TheAlkaloid}.

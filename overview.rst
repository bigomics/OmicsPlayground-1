Overview
================================================================================
The Omics Playground is a user-friendly and interactive web-based platform 
for the analysis and visualization of transcriptomics and proteomics data. 
Currently the platform handles gene expression microarray, RNA-seq and 
LC-MS/MS proteomics data, and supports two species, human and mouse. The Omics 
Playground has been in particular devised to also support single cell RNA-seq 
data, as well as traditional gene expression experiments. 

The overview of the platform is shown in the figure below. It consists of
two main components. The first component addresses the data
cleaning and preprocessing, which includes preparing the input data, filtering,
normalising and precomputing of statistics for some analyses. The second part is
composed of the online interface, which supports the real-time visualisation and
interaction with users.

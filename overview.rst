Overview
================================================================================

The Omics Playground platform offers a unique combination of features that 
distinguishes it from the other analytics platforms currently available. 
We believe that data preprocessing (primary analysis) and statistical 
testing (secondary analysis) are now well established, and the most challenging 
task is currently data interpretation (tertiary analysis) that often takes the 
longest time but where actual insights can be gained. Therefore the Omics 
Playground focuses strongly on tertiary analysis while providing good support 
for secondary analysis.

The overview of the platform is shown in the figure below. It consists of
two main components. The first component addresses the data
cleaning and preprocessing, which includes preparing the input data, filtering,
normalising and precomputing of statistics for some analyses. The second part is
composed of the online interface, which supports the real-time visualisation and
interaction with users.

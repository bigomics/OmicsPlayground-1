The Omics Playground is a user-friendly and interactive web-based platform 
for the analysis and visualization of transcriptomics and proteomics data. Omics 
Playground allows users to apply a multitude of state-of-the-art analysis tools 
to their own data to explore and discover underlying biology in a short time.

The overview of the platform is shown in the figure 
below. It consists of two main components. The first component addresses the data
cleaning and preprocessing, which includes preparing the input data, filtering,
normalising and precomputing of statistics for some analyses. The second part is
composed of the online interface, which supports the real-time visualisation and
interaction with users.

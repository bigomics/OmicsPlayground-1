Omics Playground: Explore Omics Data Freely
================================================================================
The Omics Playground is a comprehensive self-service platform platform 
for visualization, analytics and exploration of Big Omics Data. 
It allows users to apply a multitude of state-of-the-art analysis tools 
to their own data to explore and discover underlying biology in a short time.

The platform offers a unique combination of features that 
distinguishes it from the other analytics platforms currently available. 
We believe that data preprocessing (primary analysis) and statistical 
testing (secondary analysis) are now well established, and the most challenging 
task is currently data interpretation (tertiary analysis) that often takes the 
longest time but where actual insights can be gained. Therefore the Omics 
Playground focuses strongly on tertiary analysis while providing good support 
for secondary analysis.

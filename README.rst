Omics Playground: Visualization, analytics and exploration of Omics Data
================================================================================


Omics Playground: A comprehensive self-service platform for visualization, analytics and exploration of Big Omics Data
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Omics Playground is a user-friendly and interactive web-based platform 
for the analysis and visualization of transcriptomics and proteomics data. 
It allows users to apply a multitude of state-of-the-art analysis tools 
to their own data to explore and discover underlying biology in a short time.

The Omics Playground currently handles gene expression microarray, RNA-seq and 
LC-MS/MS proteomics data, and supports two species, human and mouse. The Omics 
Playground has been in particular devised to also support single cell RNA-seq 
data, as well as traditional gene expression experiments.
